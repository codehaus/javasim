This is beta-release version 1.7.4 of C++SIM. 

Change log is:

1.0: Initial release.
1.1: Bug fixes to 1.0 and enhancements to allow g++ to work with Sun's
     lwp package.
1.2: More bug fixes and general tidy up.
1.3: Brought the system more in line with SIMULA.
1.4: Added ability to delete threaded objects and reactivate main.
1.5: Brought up-to-date with internal release, added debugging and
     statistics classes, and added event handling mechanisms. Bug
     fixes, and C++ Task Library support.
1.6: Improved scheduler class and scheduler list classes. Support for
     various pthreads implementations and cthreads. Contributions to
     scheduler list classes and Quick Threads support.
1.7: Removed the limitation on thread package inheritence: applications
     no longer need to be rebuilt when C++SIM changes thread usage. Bug
     fixes. Some new statistical distributions, and more thread package
     porting.
