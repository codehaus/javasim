 * Defines flags (-D, -U etc) that are applicable to a
 * specific VENDOR (eg sun, dec, hp etc)
 * These flags are passed on to the compiler when building Arjuna
 *
 * Defines preceded by STUBGEN_ are always quoted strings and are used
 * by the stub generator IFF the header file is processed with something
 * other than the standard C++ compiler (we assume that the standard C++
 * compiler would set these flags itself)
 *
 * Examples:
 *   #define VENDOR_SPECIFIC_FLAGS
 *   #define STUBGEN_VEND_FLAGS "-Dsun"
 *
 * Here the VENDOR_SPECIFIC_FLAGS are empty since we assume that -Dsun is set
 * by default by the compiler front end. However, the flag is present in the
 * STUBGEN_VEND_FLAGS since it may be using cpp directly
