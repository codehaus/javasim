Currently there  is no equivalent script to  'configure' to enable the
system to be built from the shell. It has only been tested with Visual
C++, and is built from the graphical environment.

Because of limitations in Visual C++, it is not  possible to get it to
directly compile .cc files as C++. Renaming all of the files to a .cpp
equivalent is not  an option (although users  are free to do so). This
limitation does not appear  when using the  system from the shell,  as
there does exist a command-line option to specify what  is a C++ file.
For the  moment    there  exist  several temporary  files    with .cpp
extensions, and these simply include the real .cc files(!)

When building for NT the options for  the  thread type and  queue type
are  hard-wired into the  file NT_Configure.h. If  you want to  change
them, edit this file.
