This is  public release  version 1.7.4 beta   of C++SIM, a set of  C++
class definitions  that mimic the process-based  simulation facilities
of SIMULA and the SIMSET routines.

The  co-routine facility of Simula   is implemented by various threads
(and others).  Classes  are    provided  for various   random   number
distributions.

If  you  find any bugs  or make  modifications (e.g.,  ports  to other
thread packages) or port the package to other systems then let me know
so I can keep the sources up-to-date for other users.
